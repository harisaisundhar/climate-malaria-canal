- The life cycles and transmission of most infectious agents are inextricably
  linked with climate.
- This research revolves around analysing how the factors of
  climate influences its developments and spreading.
- Extreme weather, increased temperature, and air quality poses direct risk to
  human vector borne disease.
- Air quality affects the survival rates of pathogens,
  while the temperature influences the life cycle of mosquitoes and transmitters.
- Further warmer temperature and humidity favours the breeding of insects.
  On the other hand, Rapidly increasing population enhances the transmission of
  vector-borne diseases (like dengue, malaria), as Indirect risks are mediated
  through social processes (e.g., human-vector contacts).
